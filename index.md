You've reached my digital presence. 

I'm a human based out of San Francisco (mostly). Previously, I've spent chunks of my life in New York, Vancouver, Canada, and Shanghai. 
                    
I currently spend my time on machine learning research and engineering problems at [Ritual](https://ritual.net/). I previously built Socket (acq. 2023), and worked at [Schmidt Futures](https://www.schmidtfutures.org/). I studied Math (B.S) and Computer Science (M.S) at Stanford. 

Some things that interest and have interested me in the past: 

- Open-source model inference and adaptation
- Robustness, interpretability, and provenance of models
- AI governance and policy 
- Applications of models for science, policy, and problems in the physical world
- startups, ventures, and new things
- good coffee and scenic running routes

Some other organizations and communities I've spent a bit of time in below. Check out more specific projects, papers, and experiences [here](/build)
